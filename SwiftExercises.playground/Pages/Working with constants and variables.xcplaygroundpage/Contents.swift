//Exercise: Working with constants and variables

//Step 1: Create a constant for the day of the week
let day = "Monday"

//Step 2: Create a constant for the temperature
let dailyTemp = 75

//Step 3: Print the current day
print("Today is \(day). Rise & shine!")

//Step 4: Print the daily temperature
print("The temperature on \(day) is \(dailyTemp)ºF")

//Step 5: Create a variable
var temp = 70

//Step 6: Print the morning temperature
print("The temperature on \(day) morning is \(temp)ºF")

//Step 7: Change the value
temp = 80

//Step 8: Print the evening temperature
print("The temperature on \(day) evening is \(temp)ºF")

//Step 9: Create another constant
let weeklyTemp = 75

//Step 10: Set the value of a variable based on the value of another constant
temp = weeklyTemp

//Step 11: Print the average weekly temperature
print("The average temperature this week is \(temp)ºF")
